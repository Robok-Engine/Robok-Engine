## üìù TO-DO

- [ ] Fully Java & Kotlin Compiler
- [ ] Code Diagnostics
- [X] Code Editor
- [X] Project Creation
- [ ] Full 3D Modeling
- [ ] Robok SDK Stable integration
- [ ] Robok SDK Auto Completion
- [ ] Improve Libs system (For now, each project has its libs folder in the app's private directory, however, this is not good, because if the user deletes the project outside of Robok, the libs remain there. or if he doesn't create the project through Robok, the libs won't be there.)
- [ ] Stable Conversion of assets/ to res/
